# 📝 My Blog on Data Engineering

A personal blog built with **Django Framework** , **Python** and **PythonAnywhere** hosting to share insights, tutorials, and experiences around **Data Engineering, ETL/ELT, Data Warehousing, Azure Cloud, AI, and Analytics**.  

This project is both a **learning journey** (sharpening my web development skills) and a **knowledge-sharing platform** for the data community.

## 📖 Learning Journey

This project started as a small experiment but turned into a **full-fledged blog platform**. Along the way, I learned:  

### 🔹 Django Basics
- Setting up projects and apps (`startproject`, `startapp`)  
- Models, Views, Templates (MVT architecture)  
- Admin panel customization  

### 🔹 Frontend Integration
- Linking static files correctly in Django  
- Using `blog.css` to manage blog styling  
- Debugging CSS caching issues (local + production)  

### 🔹 Dynamic Content
- Querying posts in `views.py` (`Post.objects.all()`)  
- Rendering content in templates with `{% for post in posts %}`  
- Handling published vs draft posts  

### 🔹 Deployment
- Hosting the app on **PythonAnywhere**  
- Mapping static files in the *Web tab*  
- Running `collectstatic` for production readiness  
- Fixing caching and refresh issues for updated CSS  

### 🔹 Version Control & Collaboration
- Using **GitHub** for versioning  
- Syncing changes between local and hosted versions  
- Structuring commits for clarity (bug fixes, features, styling updates)
